"""
q5 reverse_lookup()
Write a function named reverse_lookup that finds all of the keys in a dictionary that map to a specific value.
The function will take the dictionary and the value to search for as its only parameters. It will return a
(possibly empty) list of keys from the dictionary that map to the provided value.

Include a main program that demonstrates the reverseLookup function as part of your solution to this exercise.
Your program should create a dictionary and then show that the reverseLookup function works correctly when it
returns multiple keys, a single key, and no keys. Ensure that your main program only runs when the file containing
your solution to this exercise has not been imported into another program.
