"""
perfect numbers
An integer, n, is said to be perfect when the sum of all of the proper divisors
of n is equal to n. For example, 28 is a perfect number because its proper
divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14, and 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.

Write a function that determines whether or not a positive integer is perfect.
Your function will take one parameter. If that parameter is a perfect number
then your function will return true. Otherwise it will return false.
